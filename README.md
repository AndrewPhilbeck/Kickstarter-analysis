# Kickstarter Analysis with Excel

## Overview of Project

A play, titled _Fever_ recently fell short of its Kickstarter goal. The author of the play has asked for an analysis of different kickstarter campaigns, both successes and failures, to find out if there is any connection between their launch date, their fundrasing goals and their success or failure so she can make adjustments to future projects should these findings prove beneficial. Using the data from over 4,000 projects in both the US and around the world I was able discern results based on the two criteria she requested.

### Discovering connections between launch date, goals set, and successful funding in Kickstarter.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The first analysis based on launch date concluded that the two most successful months to launch on Kickstarter are May and June. The months which provided the most failed launches were January, May, June, and October. Seeing this I limited the data to only plays, since this was the category of kickstarter, _Fever_, which nearly reached its goal. Upon doing this the data revealed similar results. The most successful months for launching a kickstarter campaign for plays were May and June. With these months seeming to spike in their success rate with 111 successful campaigns launched in May and 100 in June. The number of failed kickstarters for plays stayed between thirty and fifty over the course of twelve months, with one exception of fifty-two in May.

Here is the correspoing graph which reveals the information based on plays launched on Kickstarter over a twelve month period.(![Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115502048/197422842-63737ced-a487-4824-b99c-31be67daebf0.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The second analysis, based on monitary goals set for plays launched on Kickstarter concluded the most successful funding goals were between $0 and $5,000 with around 75% of plays receving funding, the next highest success rate was goals between $35,000 and $45,000 with 67% of plays launched receiving funding. The failure rate for projects launched increased from only 24% of projects failing with a goal of less than $1,000 up to 80% failing with a goal $25,000 to $30,000. The failure rait did drop significantly for projects launched with goals between $35,000 and $45,000. However, the small number of projects launched with such high goals, as well as the fact that the play in question _Fever_ had a goal of less than $3,000, the outcomes based on goals concludes that this information does not aid in researching why _Fever_ was not able to reach its goal. _We should not think simply that if the goal had been for $35,000+ this alone would have resuleted in a successful rather than failed kickstarter._

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The =COUNTIFS formula for the Outcomes Based on Goals chart proved difficult for me. I spent time on trial and error as well as googled examples and watched videos of how to enter the formula correctly before I was able to accomplish the goal. Once I realized that the same column needed to be used for both the >= and <= sides of the formula I was able to move forward. I also learned out to make a formula an absolute and not relative it was much easier to pupulate the rest of the cells. 

Understanding the language as well as the specifics of the formulas in excel is the largest obstacle for me to overcome at this point. I can follow directions but was sometimes unclear as to what I was actually doing because of the langauge barrier. Overcoming this will take take and more expereince.
